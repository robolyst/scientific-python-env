# Scientific Python Environment

This is a jupyter lab python environment that runs inside a docker container.

## Get started

Run `docker-compose up` to start the jupyter lab server. If this is the first
time you are running the command, it may take a while to download and install
everything.

Once the server is up and running, point your webbrowser to
`http://localhost:8888`.
